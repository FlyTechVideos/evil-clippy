Clippy, but he is not so friendly.

As seen in [this YouTube video from FlyTech Videos](https://youtu.be/1jQbf59Jq2s).

Install Clippy using the installer. Then, press Ctrl+, (Comma) to make it appear and disappear, or click the icon in the taskbar.

To use Clippy, you need to prepare replay scripts. You can find the scripts from the video in [./demo-scripts](demo-scripts). Place them in `%appdata%/EvilClippy/scripts`. Then load them by typing `/load script1.tsv` into Clippy. If you want to abort a certain script, wait for any message in progress to finish, then type `/clear` and load another script.

Contributions and forks welcome.
